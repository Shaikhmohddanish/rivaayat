          Rivaayat is a movement reimagining Indian crafts with minimal elegance, empowering and honoring the artisans
          behind every weave. Each piece is a dialogue between past and present, carrying the stories of skilled hands
          and resilient spirits. We honor authenticity in every detail&mdash;from the weave of fabric to the words we
          speak&mdash;and our language flows between Hindi, Roman Urdu, and English, echoing the diversity of the land we
          represent.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          We stand with artisans whose hands preserve centuries of skill and with women whose voices inspire change.
          Together, they shape Rivaayat into a story of continuity&mdash;where the past is respected, the present is
          celebrated, and the future is imagined with courage. Rivaayat is not just fashion; it is memory, movement, and
          meaning&mdash;a story that belongs to all of us.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Rivaayat&rsquo;s mission is simple yet profound: to carry the past forward, to dress the present with pride, and to
          imagine a future where tradition and modernity walk hand in hand.
