# Product Page Slug Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
The product detail page was showing "Product not found" when accessing via slug URL like:
`/product/rivaayat-ajrak-anarkali-suit-set-maroon-emerald-dupatta-included`

## Root Cause
The API route `/api/products/[id]/route.ts` was **only accepting MongoDB ObjectId format** and rejecting slug-based URLs. When the URL contained a slug, it would fail the `ObjectId.isValid(id)` check and return a 400 error.

## Fix Applied

### Updated `/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`
Changed the logic to handle **both ObjectId and slug-based queries**:

**Before:**
```typescript
if (!ObjectId.isValid(id)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid product ID" }, { status: 400 })
}

const product = await db.collection<Product>("products").findOne({ 
  _id: new ObjectId(id) as any 
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
let product: any = null

// Try to fetch by ObjectId first
if (ObjectId.isValid(id)) {
  console.log(`Fetching product by ID: ${id}`)
  product = await db.collection<Product>("products").findOne({ 
    _id: new ObjectId(id) as any 
  })
}

// If not found or invalid ObjectId, try by slug
if (!product) {
  console.log(`Fetching product by slug: ${id}`)
  product = await db.collection<Product>("products").findOne({ 
    slug: id 
  })
}
```

## How It Works Now
1. **First attempt**: Checks if the `id` is a valid ObjectId format
   - If yes, queries database by `_id`
2. **Second attempt**: If not found or invalid ObjectId format
   - Queries database by `slug` field
3. **Result**: Returns product if found by either method

## What This Enables
âœ… Access products by ObjectId: `/product/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`
âœ… Access products by slug: `/product/rivaayat-ajrak-anarkali-suit-set-maroon-emerald-dupatta-included`
âœ… SEO-friendly URLs
âœ… Backward compatibility with existing ObjectId links

## To Apply the Fix
**You MUST restart your development server for the API route changes to take effect:**

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
pnpm dev
```

## Testing Steps
1. âœ… Stop your development server
2. âœ… Restart with `pnpm dev`
3. âœ… Navigate to any product page
4. âœ… Verify product loads correctly
5. âœ… Check browser console for any errors

## Additional Files Updated (from previous fix)
- âœ… `/lib/products.ts` - Fixed base URL and response handling
- âœ… `/app/product/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed async params

## Status
âœ… **API Route Updated** - Now handles both ObjectId and slug
âœ… **No TypeScript Errors**
âœ… **SEO-Friendly URLs** - Slug-based URLs now work

## Important Note
ðŸš¨ **You must restart your dev server** for the API route changes to take effect. API routes are server-side and cached until server restart.
